Greetings! I am a researcher, engineer, and entrepreneur passionate about high-accuracy localization, wireless communications, and next-generation tracking technologies. My academic journey spans multiple continents, beginning with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (specializing in communications) from the [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en), Iran, in 2016. I then pursued my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at [Lehigh University](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ece), Pennsylvania, USA, where I deepened my expertise in signal processing and wireless systems, earning my degree in 2018.

Building on this foundation, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/), in December 2023. Under the co-supervision of Professor [Angelos Stavrou](https://computing.ece.vt.edu/~angelos/) and Professor [Haining Wang](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/wangh.html), my doctoral research focused on wireless communications, security, and high-precision positioning technologies, with applications in UAV localization, advanced 5G/6G networks, and AR/VR/MR systems.

Following my Ph.D., I co-founded [WayWave Inc.](https://waywave.com/) alongside Professor Angelos Stavrou. At WayWave, we bridge cutting-edge research and product development, working on next-generation localization and tracking solutions. Our work spans from high-accuracy tracking for AR/VR/MR systems to passive detection and localization of intruder objects using spaceborne illumination. Additionally, we are pioneering photonic-based high-accuracy timing systems that have the potential to revolutionize ranging capabilities and beyond.

My expertise lies at the intersection of wireless systems, positioning and navigation, security, signal processing, and photonic-based timing technologies, and I am driven by the challenge of transforming theoretical advancements into real-world solutions.
