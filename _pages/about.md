I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering with the specification in communications from the [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en), Tehran, Iran in 2016.  Then I completed my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from [Lehigh University](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ece), Pennsylvania, USA in 2018.  I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/). I am co-supervised by Professor [Angelos Stavrou](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/angelos.html) and Professor [Haining Wang](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/hnw.html) in the Network and Software Security Lab (NSSL).


My research interests include security issues in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), localization/tracking/navigation for UAVs, positioning in cellular networks with the focus on 5G/6G, specifically high-accuracy localization for Augmented/Virtual/Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR), and wireless communications/networking.
