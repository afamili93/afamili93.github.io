Greetings! I'm an eager researcher in the field of Electrical & Computer Engineering with an academic journey that spans continents. I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, specializing in communications, from the esteemed [University of Tehran](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en), Tehran, Iran in 2016. Following that, I ventured to the United States, where I completed my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at [Lehigh University](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ece), Pennsylvania, USA in 2018.

Currently, I'm engaged in the pursuit of a Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the renowned [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/), under the co-supervision of two distinguished professors, Professor [Angelos Stavrou](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/angelos.html) and Professor [Haining Wang](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/hnw.html), within the Network and Software Security Lab (NSSL).

My research interests are diverse, encompassing critical areas such as security in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), wireless communications/networking, UAV localization, and positioning techniques in advanced cellular networks like 5G New Radio (NR) and beyond (6G) with a special focus on high-accuracy localization for Augmented/Virtual/Mixed Reality (AR/VR/MR).
